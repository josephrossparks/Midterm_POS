# Point of Purchase Project: Smoothie Shop!

## So what is this?

This POP app is intended to be used at a brick and mortar location for taking orders and accepting payments.  Ideally it is to be used by the employees themselves either at an actual checkout location or untethered on the shop floor amongst customers.  It is designed mobile-first with a wider (likely tablet) layout for the purchase counter.

## Why are you making this?

Originally this app concept was created as a midterm project for a Grand Circus front-end web development bootcamp in 2017.  At that time, the app was written entirely as an HTML/CSS/JavaScript static website.  We are now re-imagining the app using a React/Redux framework and fully functional backend.

## What does it do?

Ideally, the app accomplishes the following:

* Lists all products available
* Allows for dynamic adding / removal of items for checkout
* Allows for purchase of items using credit card or cash
* Shows transaction result and (if cash payment) change to be given to customer

We're adding some back-end functionality:

* Employee login
* Manager functions (updates to product list)

## What team is building this?
